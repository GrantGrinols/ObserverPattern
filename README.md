# ObserverPattern
A project that I did that fetches the stock market in real time. For the first two 'loops' there is an observer that updates prices automatically to show that the observer itself is working in an offline scenario. Then the software prints out the stock prices to what it is in real time every two seconds. Together, you have a real-time observer.
